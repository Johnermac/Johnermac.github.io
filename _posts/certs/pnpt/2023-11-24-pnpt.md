# My Review

|Difficulty: ★★☆☆☆|
|Price: ★★☆☆☆|
|Material: ★★★☆☆|
|Real-World Scenario: ★★★☆☆|
|Worth it?: Yes, great option as a second cert after eJPT|

> I completed all the courses of TCM in 2021. I suppose they may have updated the content by now, but the explanations were really good and concise

> I didn't take that exam at the time because I had already completed the ECPPT. However, when I have the opportunity, I will take it and share the results here
