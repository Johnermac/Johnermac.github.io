| Cross-Site Scripting leaves web apps vulnerable to script injections by authenticated users, risking session cookie theft, redirection to harmful sites, or unauthorized actions on behalf of users |

During the assessment, a Stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability was discovered in MHA Systems:

Through the '**Consulta/Cadastro**' field, followed by clicking the '**Novo**' button. This functionality allows us to create a new record:

![Alt text](/assets/images/posts/cve/images/0.png){: .align-center}

But as an attacker, it's possible to inject malicious code into the '**Query**' field:

![Alt text](/assets/images/posts/cve/images/1.png){: .align-center}

The code is interpreted and executed by the application, which in this case showcases an alert message.

![Alt text](/assets/images/posts/cve/images/2.png){: .align-center}

NOTE: The type of this Cross-Site Scripting is Stored. Bearing that in mind, it affects every user in the system.

> This vulnerability was discovered by two security researchers:

- Jo√£o Silveira - [Johnermac](https://johnermac.github.io)
- Leonardo Teodoro - [SQU4NCH](https://squ4nch.github.io)
