| SQL Injection allows authenticated attackers to run unauthorized SQL commands, compromising systems by injecting malicious code into web forms, leading to access to sensitive data, manipulation of database contents, or even complete compromise of the system |

During the assessment, a SQL Injection was found in MHA Systems.

Through the '**Consulta/Executa**' field, followed by clicking the any of the options listed. This functionality allows us to consult records in the database:

![Alt text](/assets/images/posts/cve/images/5.png){: .align-center}

It was identified that in any field of "**Parâmetros**" the user input was not filtered, because of that, our request is send directly to the database query.

In this case, we inserted the single quote to test the error response:

![Alt text](/assets/images/posts/cve/images/6.png){: .align-center}

The error says that "*SQL was not finished correctly*", with this information in hands we could go further with the tests:

By changing the parameter to "*'UNION SELECT 1,2,3;*", the error message also changes to "*Keyword FROM was not found in the request*":

With this last test, it was possible to retrieve some information from the database:

To automate the exploration process, we used the tool *SQLMAP* to dump the tables of the database. And as we can see below, it shows two types of payloads, that being: Error-based and Time-based blind:

Below are the results of the *DUMP*:
