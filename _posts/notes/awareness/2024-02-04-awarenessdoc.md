Hi, I've written a document covering various awareness topics such as passwords, Wi-Fi, home office, social media, and safe web browsing. 

I will share the PDF here, and you can access the Word document on my GitHub (link below) to edit, add a cover image, and modify the company name accordingly.

> I hope this document helps raise awareness in the cyber community

**Introduction**:

Research suggests that human error is present in 90% of information leakage cases.
This guide aims to raise awareness among your employees and
consequently reduce the risk of data losses, information leaks, penalties, business and
resource losses, and, especially, the risk of damage to the company's image and
reputation.

The issues presented in this guide address common errors observed in the daily
activities of employees in any company, such as those related to email access, internet
browsing, improper use of external devices, among others.
Therefore, we have included mandatory rules in this document that must be followed by
all employees working with company equipment and/or in their digital environments, as
well as recommendations for best practices to enhance the security of our technological
environment. "Company name" will continuously monitor compliance with the rules
and recommendations presented here.
