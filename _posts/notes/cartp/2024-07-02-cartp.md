# My Review

|Difficulty: ★★☆☆☆|
|Price: ★★★☆☆| $449 |
|Material: ★★★☆☆|
|Real-World Scenario: ★★★☆☆|
|Worth it?: Yes, as a Intro to Azure Pentesting|
|Official Site: [CARTP by Altered Security](https://www.alteredsecurity.com/azureadlab)|


# Lab

It's a nice practical intro to Azure Pentesting. The lab has four cyber kill chains, which is the right amount to learn a lot of things.
I had two minor problems with the labs, and that was solved in less than 24 hours by the Altered Security support team.

- Labs in Cloud environment are always tricky, cause (it this case) Microsoft could change something and affect the labs
- For example, now in July Azure there is an "update" for reinforced MFA, so it may affect some type of attacks displayed in the labs, idk

I always study certifications in 3 steps:

- Watch the videos first and try to focus fully on the explanations
- Do the labs with the help of the materials
- Revise the material, its when I start to do my notes to future usage and to help in the exam too
- [EXTRA] If I have enough time, I try to do the lab without any help


# Exam

For me, there is no easy practical exams, because there is always something that you forget and get stuck.
But it was not hard. I mean, its really the same level of CRTP but in Azure

- There is only one cyber kill chain, with 5 resources and two tenants

I had no problems with the exam, no lags and no bugs whatsoever

All that's in the materials is enough to pass

> I got stuck for 2 hours in one resource, cause I forgot a dumb Detail. 

I took a total of 7 hours to complete and 1 or 2 hours with the report


# Conclusion

I dont have a comparison, cause It's my first certification on Cloud Pentesting. 

Honest opinion: I enjoyed the whole process but ...

> *I didnt like the way they split the content*

Look, its 4 paths with different attacks. But they dont teach the paths in sequence. 

- You start with the first attack of the first path... its usually Initial Access Attacks
- Then you go to the first attack of the second path, and so on

> *When u are in the middle of the paths, you don't remember how the hell you got that access!*


My opinion: Explain the attacks first without any path. After explaining the attacks, do the videos of explanation in sequence with the PATHS.

SO, Instead of spliting the content by Learning Objects: 1,2,3,4,5.. etc

Split the content by Cyber kill Chain 

*FOR EXAMPLE*: 

  - ATTACKS EXPLANATION (Intro, How to attack, when is possible to attack, possible defenses that you can encounter)
  - PATH 1
  - PATH 2
  - PATH 3
  - PATH 4


Besides that, good job [Altered Security](https://www.alteredsecurity.com/). Amazing content!
