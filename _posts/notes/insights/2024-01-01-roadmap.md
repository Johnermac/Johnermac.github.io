# Roadmap Pentest - 2024

> A lot of people asked me (*maybe 3* jk) So...

Here's **my honest opinion** in what's the most *effective path to be a Pentester*

{% include video id="HkE83Zu8z58" provider="youtube" %}

> There is no "correct path". Each one build its own path, because everyone has a different background

IF you have no patience just click in the link below to go to the last chapter:

[CHAPTER: Summarizing](https://johnermac.github.io/insights/roadmap/#summarizing)

# Background

So lets speak about background - What I mean by this?

> *"First of all Pentest is like Brazil, not for beginners"* -Johnermac

- Its recommended that you have a field of *expertise*. 

This field can vary from:
```
- Network Admin
- Developer
- System Admin 
- Others
```

> btw A complete beginner can start as an IT Support before choosing a more advanced field


You may ask: **Why a field before pentesting is important**?

Its important cause it helps you be a good professional!

> *"Pentest is only fun if you are good enough to find stuff"*

You dont need to be an Expert in any of those, but a intermediate level gonna be helpful

## How Helpful?

Pentest learns through the job, that means that u'll Test a lot of technology that you've never seen before

- And if you have knowledge in those fields, u'll mix them with the curiosity and skills of breaking stuff

**Networking** is gonna be helpful to understand the infrastructure, to understand the defense mechanisms in order to be stealthy and consequently bypass the defense

**System admin** gonna be helpful to know the commands, directories, patterns, important files, etc of a operational system (Unix, Windows, MacOS, etc)

**Developer** from my point of view is the most helpful field, cause you'll be a good web pentester, you'll learn how to develop exploits much easier and be a great asset for the team because of that

> Lets say you go directly to Pentest, Its ok too, but u'll lack fundamentals and it'll be much harder to learn stuff on the spot

## BUILD

Each professional will have these skills in rankings, just like a RPG!

Lets grab an Example:

| Network | Programming | System |
| ★★★★☆ | ★★☆☆☆ | ★★★☆☆ |

> Not an Expert in any field, but have the fundamentals (or at least try to have) 

This is the professional **BEFORE** going to PENTEST!

Besides the fundamentals, a security professional will have a large set of skills, for example:

| Fundamentals | Audit | Forensics | Reverse Engineering | Cyber Operation | 
| ★★★★☆ | ★★★☆☆ | ★★☆☆☆ | ★★★☆☆ | ★★★★☆ |

There is also the *SOFT SKILLS*:

- Soft skills equals *Communication, Documentation and Leadership*

| Fundamentals | Audit | Forensics | Reverse Engineering | Cyber Operation | Soft Skills |
| ★★★★☆ | ★★★☆☆ | ★★☆☆☆ | ★★★☆☆ | ★★★★☆ | ★★★☆☆ |


And each topic has its owns sub-topics, for example:

| Web | API | Mobile | Active Directory | Container | Cloud | Physical Pentest | Low Level | etc |


> Thats your **BUILD**. Everybody likes different things, and thats good! 

> Because a TEAM needs people with different set of skills and its *Impossible* to master everything (maybe not impossible, but lets say: *it takes a lot of time* )


So, As you progress you'll have a set of skills to “build your character”

> Thats why the fundamentals are important


# Roadmap

> *Enough of Chit-Chat*

OK, lets say you're not a begginer and want to go from a Desktop Support to a Pentester (*developer, network admin, sys admin is even better as I said before*)

**What Do I recommend?**

> 4 Steps - straight to the point

## 1. Learn the fundamentals 

> (Basics of Security, Linux, Windows, Networking, one Programming language) 

- You can learn the **basics of Security** from **Security+** CompTIA material
- You can learn **Linux** from **LPIC-1** LPI material or from **Linux+** CompTIA material 
- You can learn **Network** from **Network+** CompTIA material
- You can learn **Windows** from **Microsoft material**
- You can learn a **Programming Language** with **freecodecamp** or **CodeAcademy**
- Plus - *Youtube* is a helpful resource for everything nowadays

> The programming language can be *Python, Ruby, C, C++, Javascript, C#, Java, PHP, etc* doesn't matter - pick one that you like the most

- I say that doesn't matter, because u'll learn others throughout your journey anyway

> But if I could start again i'd choose **C** for internal and **Javascript** for external

### Where to learn the fundamentals?

> The best place to start in my opinion is **TryHackMe**. But here are some suggestions:

- [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/)
- [Hack The Box](https://academy.hackthebox.com/)
- [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/)
- [OverTheWire - Wargames](https://overthewire.org/wargames/)

## 2. Certifications

In my opinion Certifications are important because it gives u the material organized.

> btw, it can be done without certifications, but it requires a *GREAT* organization and patience that I dont have

> Cause Sometimes you are saving money, but you are spending a lot of time to learn the same topic. 

> Anyway Keep in mind: Balance is everything

So, there is 2 types of certifications

1. The ones that you will use to **LEARN**
2. The ones that will help u to get a **JOB**

### In my opinion The best PATH is

1. eJPT by INE 
2. One full practical pentest cert (eCPPT, PNPT, CPTS) - **In my opinion, the best here are the two last ones (PNPT by TCM or CPTS by HackTheBox)**
3. Get one cert to bypass HR + To get a JOB (OSCP, CEH) - These are the most asked, both are expensive and not great, but their purposes is to get you a job, **I'd rather choose OSCP here**
4. After that, choose a Field of specialization (Mobile, Container, IOT, Cloud security, Car hacking, WiFi hacking, Linux, Windows, Malware Development, etc) **There are so many fields, choose one that u like the most**
5. With XP, Certifications and a field of specialization in no time you'll be a valuable asset for any company


## 3. Job = Experience

Its a bit tricky to get the first job in pentesting because everyone asks for experience, but how you are gonna get the xp in first place if nobody wanna hire you?

> *Nothing in this world is guaranteed*, but in my point of view

If you:

- Have worked in IT before,
- Are making connections on LinkedIn (this might be the most important),
- Hold some certifications (especially OSCP),
- Showcase your projects/GitHub on your LinkedIn/Socials

You are on the right path to get a JOB in the offensive security field!

> **If u r feeling like you're sending ur resume into a black hole and getting zero love in return, you're not alone.**

Perhaps you need to get a job in cyber first:

- SOC positions;
- Security Analyst;
- OSINT analyst
- etc

**And then LATER switch to Pentest**!

> [NOTE] In your studies for Pentest, not only learn how to attack but also take some time to learn how to mitigate the vulnerability!

## 4. Specialization

So, you've nailed that job – congrats! But here's the thing, in OffSec, the learning never stops! 

> Start to think which specialization u are gonna choose. And go for it.

Keep in mind that fields are inter-connected. For example:

**Windows**:

- If you have xp as Network Admin
- C#, Powershell, C as a language
- Active Directory
- good path for Windows specialization

**Malware Developer**:

- Have XP as Developer
- Enjoys low level (assembly)
- Likes to do research
- good path for maldev

**WEB**:

- Have IT xp
- Knows Javascript and PHP
- enjoy to do external pentesting
- can do bug bounty on free time
- good path for web

> These are only examples, as I said before: *u r gonna build ur own path* 

> Anyway

![Alt text](/assets/images/posts/insights/roadmap/3.png){: .align-center}



What I trying to say is: U'll get to a certain level that in order to not get stuck in ur career u gotta choose a specialization path

and every specialization has its own certifications/courses, for example:

**WINDOWS**:

| CRTP | CRTE | CRTO | CRTM | many others |

**WEB**:

| eWPT | eWPTX | OSWE | BSCP | many Others |

**MOBILE**:

| eMAPT | PJMT | 8kSEC | many others |

**Malware Development**:

| MalDev Academy |  Sektor7 | OSED | many others |

**Cloud**:

| Altered Security | CWL | Cloud Breach | HackTricks |

> First, u gotta get a job, and then u can work towards the specialization you want

- There is a lot of others certs like - SANS (*expensive*), EC-Council (*expensive*) and More

# Summarizing

1. Learn the Fundamentals (tryhackme/compTIA)
2. Learn a programming language (Python)
3. Take eJPT and PNPT
4. Take OSCP (*If you have enough money*)
5. Follow a specialization path
6. Never stop learning

In this site below u can find a lot of certifications for cybersecurity in General:

[Security Certification Roadmap](https://pauljerimy.com/security-certification-roadmap/)


**What certs I recommend for PENTEST**:

![Alt text](/assets/images/posts/insights/roadmap/1.png){: .align-center}

> *After that u can choose a specialization PATH*

- with *OSCP* is easier to get a job, but lets say u dont want to spend that amount of money (like me)

Then u can think of alternatives and jump for a specialization path (AD, WEB, MOBILE, etc):

## Is Pentesting Worth it?

> Honestly, it's not a paradise, but if u keep studying it can be fun

Positives:

- It can be fun
- Never stop learning mindset
- The feeling when discovering something big
- AI won't take over (at least not yet), because manual testing yields much better results
- The possibility of becoming a criminal at any time (joking here)

![Alt text](/assets/images/posts/insights/roadmap/7.gif){: .align-center}


Some points to consider:

- ~**40%** of the job is documentation 
- U need to keep studying forever (it gets tiring)
- You must be at least a bit communicative, because of *debriefing* (its when u show the results to clients)
- Sometimes the scope of projects is just a login page of a WordPress (**angry face**)
- It pays well **only** if u are a ***Senior*** - Until there...
- It's hard to find a job in general because the majority of the jobs are for those who know how to harden/defend systems


![Alt text](/assets/images/posts/insights/roadmap/4.png){: .align-center}

## Expectation X Reality

![Alt text](/assets/images/posts/insights/roadmap/8.jpg){: .align-center}

| Expectation | Reality |
| It pays well | Usually pays well if u work for a bank/big company e/or u are Senior level |
| Its Fun, Its Dynamic | Its actually boring, There's a lot of bureaucracy involved with the tests (which is part of the job) |
| You learn new stuff every day | Not every day, most likely 5% of the time |
| You are gonna hack all the time | u hack 50% of the time, 40% is documentation, 5% is debriefing and 5% is meetings |
| There's a lack of professionals in the field | There's a lack of *SENIORS* in the field |

> If after reading the negative points u are still interested in the field, You've passed the test!

> Go ahead and Good luck on ur journey!
