# My Review

|Difficulty: ★★☆☆☆|
|Price: ★★★★☆| $249 |
|Material: ★★★★☆|
|Real-World Scenario: ★★★☆☆|
|Worth it?: Yes, if u want to specialize in AD|
|Official Site: [CRTP by Altered Security](https://www.alteredsecurity.com/adlab)|

> This cert is a **MUST** if u enjoy Active Directory. It teaches the fundamentals and then build around that.

I've enjoy the materials, the support and the exam. I have nothing to complain about the content

However, even tho the teachers are amazing, they have a strong Indian accent that can make it difficult to understand some subjects. Especially for someone who already speaks English as a second language.

> [ **Point for improvement** ] They can add subtitles to the videos

Another critique that I have, but this time not regarding the certification itself, pertains to the company *Altered Security*. There isn't enough content about AD exploitation to justify having three certifications (**CRTP**, **CRTE**, **CRTM**). They could improve by better segregating the content or offering discounts to those who have already obtained the previous certifications.

Apart from that, I highly recommend it.
