# My Review

|Difficulty: ★★★✦☆|
|Price: ★★★☆☆| $299 |
|Material: ★★☆☆☆|
|Real-World Scenario: ★★★☆☆|
|Worth it?: Yes, ONLY if u want to specialize in AD|
|Official Site: [CRTE by Altered Security](https://www.alteredsecurity.com/redteamlab)|

First of all the name is **misleading**, even tho I passed, I feel that I'm far away from an **EXPERT** level

> **60%** of the material is the same as the CRTP

The lab is amazing, but the exam wasn't that special. (it was tricky - I rate the difficulty: 3.5/5)


I Consider this as a specialization cert, so I recommend only if u are going for the Windows/AD path. 

> Otherwise I think only the CRTP is enough


As a lot of the material is the same as CRTP I'll add references to my CRTP notes throughout the notes of CRTE
