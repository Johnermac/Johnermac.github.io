# Lateral Movement

Same as in CRTP:

[CRTP Lateral Movement](https://johnermac.github.io/notes/crtp/latmov/)

## Extracting Credentials from LSASS

[Lsass-Shtinkering on GitHub](https://github.com/deepinstinct/Lsass-Shtinkering)

Using Lsass-Shtinkering:
```powershell
Lsass_Shtinkering.exe
```

- It uses Windows Error Reporting Service to dump the *LSASS* process memory.

> It manually reports an exception to **WER** on **LSASS** that will generate the dump without crashing the process.

- It works on *Windows 10, Server 2022*.
- During our testing we found that it doesnâ€™t work on Server 2019.
